List of changes to JMultiSliceLib

2020-04-07: 0.42 JB
- Added internal pattern averaging

2020-03-05: 0.41 JB
- Fixed a bug causing artifacts of the low-loss inelastic
  scattering code with non-square grid sizes.

2020-02-20: 0.40 JB
- Improved speed by replacing some frequent CUDA mallocs by
  static allocations in the integrated detection scheme
  (contribution by E. Westphal, FZ-Jülich)

2020-02-19: 0.39 JB
- Added an allocation memory check before the actual allocation
  call on the CUDA device to prevent persistence of out of memory
  errors into kernel launch.

2020-01-13: 0.38 JB
- Resolved a memory management bug in the results handling.
- Moved the CUDA code compilation to CUDA Toolkit v.10.2.
  The package should be shipped with 'cufft64_10.dll' or the
  library must be made available on the target machine by installing
  the respective CUDA Toolkit version.

2019-12-19: 0.36 JB
- Removed all remaining MS Windows specfic includes and declarations.
- Changed random number generator calls to <random> functions.
- Started test project JMSBench1 for benchmarking JMultiSlice.

2019-12-16: 0.35 JB
- Removed a few MS Windows specfic includes and declarations.

2019-11-19: 0.34 JB
- Added utility functions for pre-calculation settings
  SetGPUPgrLoading: set phase grating loading scheme to switch
    between pre-loading and on-demand loading
  GetDetetionSliceNum: returns number of readout planes
- Modified InitCore to be more predictable in memory usage.

2019-10-30: 0.33 JB
- Added memory cleanup calls for MKL closing leaks.
  FreeLibMem: call this before closing the calling process.
- Fixed issues with the plasmon scattering code.

2019-10-18: 0.32 JB
- Added plasmon scattering Monte-Carlo to CPU & GPU multislice.
  SetPlasmonMC: call to trigger and setup plasmon scattering

2019-10-15: 0.31 JB
- Added automatism to copy phase grating data from host memory
  on demand in case of insufficient memory on device for holding
  all phase gratings. This can affect the GPU multislice, leading
  to increased computation time by approximately a factor of 2.

2019-10-02: 0.30 JB
- Added CJFFTMKLcore for CPU FFT calculations. This code links to
  the Intel Math Kernel Library
  (mkl_intel_lp64.lib;mkl_sequential.lib;mkl_core.lib)
  Make sure to add the MKL include path and the 64-bit library
  path to the directory lists of  the JMultislice Project and the
  include path to the calling project.
  The library object code will get very large (~600MB), the final
  binary if the calling code will increase by about 30 MB.
  Speed gain can be significant for CPU calculations on smaller
  scales (<1k pixel) while not very significant on larger problems.

2019-09-16: 0.25 JB
- Modified the aperture functions to consistency with MSA and
  internally between different aperture function models.

2019-05-24: 0.24 JB
- Fixed a minor scaling issue in the sensitivity profile.

2019-05-03: 0.24 JB
- Added probe-forming aperture asymmetry.

2019-01-08: 0.23 JB
- Modified the butterfly summation unroll and fallback scenario.
- Added a class for calculating atomic form factors using the
  parameterization of Weickenmeier and Kohl, including absorptive
  form factors (still not tested).

2018-12-21: 0.22 JB fix
- Bug fix in the 2-fold summation routine.

2018-12-20: 0.22 JB
- Implemented a strided two-fold butterfly float summation speeding
  up the integration of diffraction detector signal by a significant
  ammount. The routine is slightly faster than straight summation
  but doesn't require error correction (which was 4 times more
  expensive than a straight float summation.)

2018-12-18: 0.21 JB
- Added diffraction de-scan (global m_dif_descan == 0: off, 1: on)
  per thread de-scan parameters: m_d/h_dif_ndescanx/y in [pixel]
  De-scan shifts the diffraction pattern before accumulation.
  Use DiffractionDescan(true/false) to turn the de-scan on/off.
  Use SetDiffractionDescan(whichcode, ndescanx, ndescany, iThread)
  to set de-scan values of the thread  before calling the multislice
  routines. The de-scan values should be identical to the scan values.
- Added more device and host SetData and GetData functions (CJFFTCUDAcore).
- Added external array transform interfaces FT_h and IFT_h (CJFFTWcore).
- Added wave function accumulation and readout. The detection channels
  for wave functions are triggered in the DetectorSetup() and GetResult()
  interfaces with flags _JMS_DETECT_WAVEREAL and _JMS_DETECT_WAVEFOURIER.
  Accumulating many multislice runs with these flags will sum up over
  wave functions. Renormalization of these results yields wave functions
  of the elastic channel which can be used to separate elastic images and
  TDS images from the total intensities recorded with the detection flags
  _JMS_DETECT_IMAGE and _JMS_DETECT_DIFFRACTION, respectively. Due to
  the potential hybrid multi-threading, the final separation is not
  provided by JMultiSlice and should be done by the calling code.
- Extended the LIB interface .

2018-12-15: 0.20 JB
- Added a module for probe aberrations, apertures, and wavefunctions
- Added functions to set incoming wave functions directly

2018-11-12: 0.15 JB
- Implementation of propagators and detector functions
- Fixed bugs in the multislice chain discovered when using with the Dr. Probe GUI

2018-07-11: 0.14 JB
- Added functions using smaller phase gratings than wave-functions
- Added periodically repeated sub-frame multiplications to CPU and GPU cores
- Added slice thickness data handling
- Added pure GPU memory info function
- Added function to calculate propagtors (Fresnel and planar)
- Added GNU GPL 3 License information to all source files.

2018-05-04: 0.13 JB
- Changed the implementation to a Class CJMultiSlice since the previous
  static scope implementation turned out to be unusable in a multi-thread
  scheme.

2018-05-02: 0.12 JB
- Optimized incident wave function offset calculations for GPU code.

2018-04-30: 0.11 JB
