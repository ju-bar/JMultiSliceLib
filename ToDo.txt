List of next steps and wishes for JMultiSliceLib

- Extend the LIB interface to a similar level as the C++ class interface
	* target for linking to Fortran
	* test the interface
- Test functionality of the wave function accumulation and readout interface
- Implement compiler flags to exclude the CUDA code
- Calculating plane and vortex wave functions
- Calculating object transmission functions from structure files, including structure data I/O
- Calculation of transition potentials for inelastic scattering
- Add a test folder with test programs
- Find cause for irreproducible crashes occurring from time to time.
