List of next steps and wishes for JMultiSliceLib

- Extend the LIB interface to a similar level as the C++ class interface
	* target for linking to Fortran
- Detector readout becomes the bottle neck when applied at many slices.
	* check the readout core for optimizations / cache and loop vectorization
	* check for optimization including the loop over multiple detectors
- Implement compiler flags to exclude the CUDA code
