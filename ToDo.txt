List of next steps and wishes for JMultiSliceLib

- Extend the LIB interface to a similar level as the C++ class interface
	* target for linking to Fortran
	* test the interface
- Calculating plane and vortex wave functions
- Support more atomic structure data I/O formats
- Calculation of transition potentials for inelastic scattering
