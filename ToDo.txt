List of next steps and wishes for JMultiSliceLib

- Extend the LIB interface to a similar level as the C++ class interface
	* target for linking to Fortran
- Detector readout becomes the bottle neck when applied at many slices.
	* check the readout core for optimizations / cache and loop vectorization
	* check for optimization including the loop over multiple detectors
- Implement compiler flags to exclude the CUDA code
- Test new functions for probe generation
- Interface for wave function readout
- Householding of elastic wave functions for separating thermal diffuse scattering
- Calculating plane, probe, and vortex wave functions
- Calculating object transmission functions from structure files, including structure data I/O
- Calculation of transition potentials for inelastic scattering
