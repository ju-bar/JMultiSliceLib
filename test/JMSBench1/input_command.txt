List of input commands to be set in the control file

Commands are given by a keyword followed by lines of
keyword specific input data.


set_gpu_id
<int>

	Set the ID of the GPU device to be used.


set_cpu_num
<int>

	Set the number of CPU threads to be used.


set_output_file

	Set the prefix of the output file names.


set_sample_input_form
<int>
	
	Set the type of sample data input:
	<1> structure file (CIF, CEL) *not supported yet*
	<2> slice file (SLI)


set_slc_file_name
<string>

	Set the prefix of slice file names. Full file names
	will be created by adding "_###.sli", where ### represents
	a 3 digit number of file series indices.


set_sample_thickness_max
<int>

	Set the maximum sample thickness of the calculation in number
	of structure slices.


set_sample_thickness_step
<int>

	Set the period for detector readout, to produce a thickness
	series of images.


set_sample_tilt
<float> <float>

	Set the sample tilt, i.e. the tilt of the z-axis of the input structure
	relative to the optics axis in mrad.


set_probe_ekv
<float>

	Set the energy of the electron probe in keV.


set_probe_convergence
<float>

	Set the convergence semi-angle of the electron probe in mrad.


set_det_annular
<float> <float> <float> <float> <string>

	Add an annular detector integrating signal in the diffraction
	plane.


set_det_dif

	Activate the collection of diffraction patterns for each
	probe position of the scan.
	Warning: This can produce considerable amounts of data.


set_det_padif

	Activate the collection of diffraction patterns averaged over
	probe positions of the scan.


set_det_img

	Activate the collection of probe images for each
	probe position of the scan.


set_det_paimg

	Activate the collection of probe images averaged over
	probe positions of the scan.


set_scan_sampling
<int> <int>

	Set number of scan steps along fast (x) and slow (y) scan direction.


set_scan_frame_size
<float> <float>

	Set the size of the scan frame along x and y direction in nm.


set_scan_frame_rot
<float>

	Set the scan frame rotation in degrees with respect to the x-axis
	of the sample box.


set_scan_beam_pos
<float> <float>

	Set the position of the beam (scan frame offset) relative to the
	origin of the calculation frame (sample bounding box) in nm.


set_num_repeat
<int>

	Set number of calculation repeats per scan position.
	This parameter can be used to control the amount of averaging over
	frozen-lattice varations for improving the simulation of thermal
	diffuse scattering.	Normal STEM image simulations achieve high
	quality with 10 repeats	per scan position. Diffraction and probe
	image simulations require a much larger amount of averaging with
	a few hundred or even thousand repetitions.


set_lis
<int> <float> <float> <float>

    Sets parameters of low-loss inelastic scattering simulations
	by a Monte-Carlo approach in a generalized model. Provide the
	following sequence of parameters:
	<int>    maximum number of inelastic scattering events per probe
	         electron, allows multiple scattering via Possionian
			 statistics
	<float>  mean free path for inelastic scatterin (nm),
	         regulates the general strength of inelastic scattering
	<float>  characteristic angle for inelastic scattering (mrad),
	         determines the decay of inelastic scattering with
			 increasing scattering angle, can be calculated from
			 plasmon energy Ep and kinetic energy Ek of the probe by
			 theta_E = Ep / Ek * (Ek + E0) / (Ek + 2*E0),
			 where E0 is 511 keV, the rest mass of electrons.
	<float>  critical angle for inelastic scattering (mrad),
	         determines a cut-off in momentum transfer leading to
			 significant reduction of inelastic scattering beyond
			 this angle, can be calculated for plasmons (metals)
			 from the plasmon energy via the Fermi velocity.
