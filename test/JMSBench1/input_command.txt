List of input commands to be set in the control file

Commands are given by a keyword followed by lines of
keyword specific input data.


set_gpu_id
<int>

	Set the ID of the GPU device to be used.


set_cpu_num
<int>

	Set the number of CPU threads to be used.


set_output_file

	Set the prefix of the output file names.


set_sample_input_form
<int>
	
	Set the type of sample data input:
	<1> structure file (CIF, CEL) *not supported yet*
	<2> slice file (SLI)


set_slc_file_name
<string>

	Set the prefix of slice file names. Full file names
	will be created by adding "_###.sli", where ### represents
	a 3 digit number of file series indices.


set_sample_thickness_max
<int>

	Set the maximum sample thickness of the calculation in number
	of structure slices.


set_sample_thickness_step
<int>

	Set the period for detector readout, to produce a thickness
	series of images.


set_sample_tilt
<float> <float>

	Set the sample tilt, i.e. the tilt of the z-axis of the input structure
	relative to the optics axis in mrad.


set_probe_ekv
<float>

	Set the energy of the electron probe in keV.


set_probe_convergence
<float>

	Set the convergence semi-angle of the electron probe in mrad.


set_det_annular
<float> <float> <float> <float> <string>

	Add an annular detector integrating signal in the diffraction
	plane.


set_scan_sampling
<int> <int>

	Set number of scan steps along fast (x) and slow (y) scan direction.


set_scan_frame_size
<float> <float>

	Set the size of the scan frame along x and y direction in nm.


set_scan_frame_rot
<float>

	Set the scan frame rotation in degrees with respect to the x-axis
	of the sample box.


set_scan_beam_pos
<float> <float>

	Set the position of the beam (scan frame offset) relative to the
	origin of the calculation frame (sample bounding box) in nm.


set_num_repeat
<int>

	Set number of calculation repeats per scan position.
	This parameter can be used to control the amount of averaging over
	frozen-lattice varations for improving the simulation of thermal
	diffuse scattering.	Normal STEM image simulations achieve high
	quality with 10 repeats	per scan position. Diffraction and probe
	image simulations require a much larger amount of averaging with
	a few hundred or even thousand repetitions.
