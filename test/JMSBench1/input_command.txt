	of the frame defined by set_scan_beam_pos, set_scan_frame_size,

	and probe image simulations require a much larger amount of

	         electron, allows multiple scattering via Possionian
			 statistics
	<float>  mean free path for inelastic scatterin (nm),
	         regulates the general strength of inelastic scattering
	<float>  characteristic angle for inelastic scattering (mrad),

			 increasing scattering angle, can be calculated from
			 plasmon energy Ep and kinetic energy Ek of the probe by
			 theta_E = Ep / Ek * (Ek + E0) / (Ek + 2*E0),
			 where E0 is 511 keV, the rest mass of electrons.
	<float>  critical angle for inelastic scattering (mrad),
	         determines a cut-off in momentum transfer leading to
			 significant reduction of inelastic scattering beyond
			 this angle, can be calculated for plasmons (metals)
			 from the plasmon energy via the Fermi velocity.
